# ml-sat-college

First ML project - Given an SAT score, will I get into ANY college?

This is my first project using machine learning concepts. Please be gentle. ðŸ˜…...

The details are in the Jupyter notebook `College.ipynb`.

This is here to kind of get my feet wet in:

- Python and its libraries such as numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, etc
- Tensorflow
- Machine learning concepts

I trained a logistical regression neural network model in Tensorflow using some randomly generated data simulating SAT scores correlating to whether or not that score resulted in college admission.
